# Hello world in Chef
Chef is an esoteric (or joke) programming language designed by David Morgan-Mar. 
It is based on the manipulation of data values in a number of stacks; the same idea is used in assembly programming languages. 
Each program consists at minimum of the following:
1. A title
2. A list of variables and their data values
3. A list of instructions for stack manipulation

The joke is that the variables tend to be named after basic foodstuffs, the stacks are called 'mixing bowls' and the instructions for manipulating them 'mix', 'stir', etc.. A program, then, reads much like a cooking recipe.

You can verify the program by executing it in the online compiler from the link:
