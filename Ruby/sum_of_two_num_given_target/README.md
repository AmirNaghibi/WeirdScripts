Execute the program as `ruby sum_of_two_num_given_target.rb`. It helps to find out if given an array of unique numbers, there is a combination of two numbers which adds up to a target number.

Using `product` method is like having a loop inside a loop that combines all values in array A with all values in array B.

Using `reject` method ignores all the values given in the condition.
