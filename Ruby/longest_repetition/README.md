# Longest Repetition
Execute the program using `ruby longest_repetition.rb`. It takes a string as an input and returns an array of `[<longest character>, <character count>]` as an output.

This program is used to explain the importance of method chaining.

Combining methods allows you to take the output produced by one method & pass it into another.

Just like a factory production line!

You start with some raw materials (input), then through the process of calling these methods, you slowly transform the raw materials into the desired result.
