# Singelton Design Pattern in Java

Singelton design pattern is the one of most common design pattern used in programming.

Here,I added most popular 3 ways to implement singelton design pattern.
**1.Lazy**
**2.Eager**
**3.ENUM**

## **1.Lazy Method:** 
In this method, object is created only if it is needed.
This may prevent resource wastage. An implementation of getInstance() method is required which return the instance. 
There is a null check that if object is not created then create, otherwise return previously created.

## **2.Eager Method:** 

This is the simplest method of creating a singleton class.
In this, object of class is created when it is loaded to the memory by **JVM**. 
It is done by assigning the reference an instance directly.

## **3.ENUM Method:** 

All of the above problems can be solved very easily by using the enum type to make singletons.
Since enums are inherently serializable we donâ€™t need to implement it with serializable interface.
Reflection problem is also not there. 
Therefore, it is 100% guaranteed that only one instance of the singleton is present within a **JVM**.
