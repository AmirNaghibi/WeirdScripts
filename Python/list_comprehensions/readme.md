# List Comprehensions

Chances are you’ll use a lot of lists as a Python programmer. While we’re all big fans of for loops (and nested for loops), Python provides a more concise method for handling lists and list comprehension. 

In order to keep your code elegant and readable, it’s recommended that you use Python’s comprehension features.

Syntax:
 `newList = [ expression(element) for element in oldList if condition ]`

```python
mylist = [num * num for num in range(10)]
# mylist = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

```
