# Ternary operator

the ternary operator is a simplified one-line version of the if-else statement that allows to compactly test a condition. This operator evaluates a statement and performs an action based on whether this statement is True or False.

The ternary operator has the following syntax and is usually used to determine the value of a variable, as shown below.

‚Äç `[when_true] if [condition] else [when_false]`

```python
a = 1
j = "Less than ten" if a < 10 else "More than ten" 
```

> Many C-derived languages use this syntax:

```c
<condition> ? <expression1> : <expression2>
```
