# Random YT video generator

The code searches for random videos on YouTube which should be logged with a person's gmail id.
The motive of the script is to break the bubble that the YouTube algorithm forms for any individual.
Here, bubble refers to the YouTube feeding similar type of content to the user based on his search and watch history.

Program flow :

1. The program automatically makes about 10 search queries about random words.
2. After every search the program sleeps for 5 seconds for the video to be streamed.
