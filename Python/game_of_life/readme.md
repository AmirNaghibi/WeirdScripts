a version of conway's game of life coded in python

A few things to note: I made the board edges loop, in other words
if a cell goes off the top it comes to the bottom, same for left and right
I know this is not part of the game itself but it allows some really cool patterns

Left click to add cells
right click to remove cells
click start to start the game,
click stop to pause.
click clear to clear the board.
