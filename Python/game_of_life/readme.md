a version of conway's game of life coded in python

Conway's game of life is a one player game: meaning it is based of the initial state of the board
and once started requires no human input. 

The game simulates life and death following the below rules:

1: any cell with less than 2 neighbors dies --underpopulation.

2: any cell with 2-3 neighbors lives.

3: any cell with more than three neighbors dies --overpopulation

4: any empty cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive --repopulation
