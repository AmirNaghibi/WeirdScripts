## PRINT NATURAL NUMBERS FROM 1 TO N **WITHOUT** USING SEMICOLON 

I have used two methods to implement the following program using ```C++``` :

- With *recursion*:
A function is called inside itself and prints the next number on incrementing it. This goes on till the end condition is reached that is the number reaches N.

- With *iteration*:
To implement this, while loop has been used that goes on iterating till the condition inside the for loop is not satisfied.

None of these programs have a semicolon.
